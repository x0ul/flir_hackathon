Our team name was "Byte-B-Q" and over two days we created a grillmaster's wearable device to supplement the commonly-used hand check with Flir data.

The project fused distance data from an ultrasonic rangefinder with infrared sensor data from a Flir Lepton sensor to determine the surface area of a heat-radiating object.

The wearable device would indicate whether the heat source was good for grilling, too small, or too cold with a simple LED interface.
